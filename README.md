# Firefox Right Click Search

A Firefox extension to search for selected text from the context menu using the search engines in the Firefox search settings.

[View extension on Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/right-click-search/)

## Compatability

Requires Firefox > 63. Lower versions of Firefox may allow installation, however the extension will not be added to the context menu and will appear not to work. This is due to Firefox having added new features in their add-ons API with 63 as a minimum version.
